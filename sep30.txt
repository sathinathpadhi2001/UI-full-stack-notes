JavaScript

- JavaScript is light weight interpretted and JIT compiled programming language.
- Light weight refers to less memory.
- Interpretted indicates that the program is translated line-by-line.
- Compiled specifies that all lines are translated simultaneously at the same time.
- There are 2 types of compiling techniques
    a) JIT
    b) AOT
- JIT is "Just-in-Time", which compiles the code only when it is requested.
- AOT is "Ahead-of-Time", which compiles the code before it is requested.
- If JavaScript is used in browser then a JavaScript interpreter will translate the code.
- If it is used outside browser then a JavaScript compiler will translate the code. The popular JS compilers are "Babel, V8, Node etc."
- JavaScript is a language that supports various programming paragdims like
    a) Structural
    b) Functional    
    c) Imperative
    d) Object Oriented etc..

Note: JavaScript is not an OOP language, it supports only few features of OOP.

- JavaScript is a language which is used in various implementations

    a) Client Side
    b) Server Side
    c) Database
    d) Animation etc.

JavaScript Client Side:
- JavaScript is used client side to reduce burden on server.
- It manages various interactions client side and saves round trip.
- JavaScript is used client side for
    a) DOM Manipulations
    b) Browser Interactions
    c) Validations
- DOM Manipulations
    - Data Binding
    - Class Binding
    - Style Binding
    - Event Binding
- Browser Interactions
    - Window
    - Location
    - Navigator
    - History
    - Document
- Validations
    - Contradictory Data
    - Unauthorized Data

Evolution of JavaScript:
- CERN labs introduced a script for browser by name "ECMA Script" in the early days of internet.
- Netscape communications started a browser called "Netscape Navigator".
- Netscape appointed "Brendan Eich" to design a script for their browser.
- Brendan Eich designed a script by name "Mocha", later renamed as "Live Script".
- Netscape given the responsibility of Live Script to "Sun Microsystems".
- Sun Microsystem and Netscape together renamed live script to "JavaScript".
- Netscape stopped its services in 2000 and given responsibility of JavaScript to ECMA.
- ECMA is evolving and maintaining JavaScript
- The popular JavaScript versions are
    ECMA Script 2015         ES5
    ECMA Script 2016         ES6
    ECMA Script 2017         ES7
