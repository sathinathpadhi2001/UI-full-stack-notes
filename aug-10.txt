- HTML comprises of set of elements arranged in a hierarchy called "DOM". 
  [Document Object Model]
- HTML elements are classified into 5 major groups

		a) Normal Elements
		b) Void Elements
		c) RC Data Elements
		d) Raw Text Elements
		f) Foreign Elements

Normal Element:
- It returns a presentation directly on call back.
- It doesn't require additional attributes for initial presentation.
- It starts a presentation and can't stop implicitly.
- Explicitly it is stopped by using end token.

EX:
	   <b>	Start Token
	  </b>	End Token

Void Element:
- The term void refers to "no-return". 
- Void element will not return any presentation directly on call back.
- It ends implicitly.
- Hence it doesn't require end token. 
- It is a self ending element.
- It returns presentation by using additional attributes.

Ex:	
	<img>

RC Data Type:
- Rich content data type element.
- It only to display rich text content.
- It will not allow any another element within the context.

Ex:
	<textarea> </textarea>

Raw Text Elements:
- Raw text is used for presentation.
- It doesn't require a token.

Ex:
	 &#8377;  
	 &copy;
	 &deg;

Foreign Elements:
- A foreign element is an HTML element but requires special privilegations and credentials to use in browser.
- You have to import special libraries and extensions to run in browser.

Ex: 
      SVG
      MATHML
      Canvas
